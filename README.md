# Sum Calculator for Even Numbers and Multiples of 4

## Overview

This Java program calculates the sum of even numbers and multiples of 4 that the user inputs. The user is prompted to enter numbers one by one, and the program keeps summing the values that are even and divisible by 4 until an odd number is entered.

## How It Works

- The user is repeatedly prompted to enter a number.
- If the entered number is both **even** and **a multiple of 4**, the number is added to the total sum (`toplam`).
- The loop continues until the user enters an **odd number**.
- Finally, the program prints the sum of all numbers that were even and multiples of 4.

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Copy the Java code into a file named `Main.java`.
3. Compile the Java file using the following command:

   ```
   javac Main.java
   ```

4. Run the program with the following command:

   ```
   java Main
   ```

5. Enter numbers when prompted, and the program will display the sum of even numbers that are multiples of 4.

## Example Output

```
Bir sayı giriniz:
8
Bir sayı giriniz:
12
Bir sayı giriniz:
3
girilen değerlerden çift ve 4'ün katları olan sayıları toplamı: 20
```
